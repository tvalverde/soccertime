# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `Event.child_event` property to handle polymorphic event types (`Match`, `Race`, `SimpleEvent`) cleanly in templates.
- ARIA labels to all interactive elements and links for better accessibility.
- Flags to competitions in the favorites bar for visual consistency.

### Fixed
- F1 multi-session scraping: all sessions of the same Grand Prix weekend (Libres, Clasificación al Sprint, Sprint, Clasificación, Carrera) are now stored as independent `Race` records. Previously, all sessions shared the same race name and fell within the ±2-day deduplication window, causing `MultipleObjectsReturned` which deleted all but the most recent record, keeping only the Sunday race.
- Idempotency in `scrapit` command: `Race` and `SimpleEvent` deduplication now includes `details` (session type) as part of the lookup key, so only the datetime shifts within the same session type trigger an update.
- Removed hardcoded empty state alerts in favor of the global Django messages system.
- Deployment building unrelated images: `remote_deploy` and `remote-restart` now explicitly target the `soccertime-web` service.
- PermissionError during `collectstatic` in production: added a step to `chown` the static volume to the application user before running management commands.
- Horizontal scroll issue on Fire TV Silk: removed `text-nowrap` from table cells and reverted quick-access bars to show only crests to save horizontal space.
- PermissionError ("Operation not permitted") when downloading the database, requests cache, or media via `Makefile` by correctly setting file ownership on the remote host.
- `sqlite3.OperationalError` during `scrapit` in production by moving the `REQUESTS_CACHE` file to the persistent and writable `/code/db/` directory.

### Removed
- Legacy and redundant template files: `events.html`, `match_item.html`, `simple_event_item.html`, and `event_header.html`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- `DOCKER_UID` and `DOCKER_GID` variables with fallbacks (1000:1000) to `Makefile` for consistent user mapping across development and deployment.

### Fixed
- Permission issues in `upload-db`, `upload-requests-cache`, and `upload-media` targets by adding `chown` commands. This ensures that files uploaded to Docker volumes are owned by the application user instead of `root`.

### Security
- Explicitly set the `-u` flag in all `docker compose exec` commands within the `Makefile` (both local and remote) to strictly enforce the `appuser` (1000:1000) context.
